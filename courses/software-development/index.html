      <p>I was a TA for the course in 3 semesters and got a chance to teach a diverse class of ~250 students. The course taught software engineering concepts and developing a large software (from idea to release) throughout the semester in a team of four.</p>
<p>My responsibilities included weekly lecture in a section of 30 students, supervising 8 project teams (32 students), and creating video tutorials. The project supervision was a great opportunity to closely work with students, meet weekly, explain requirements, monitor deliverables in Trello, review code in Git, etc. Many of my supervised teams built complex software with Android client, Spring back-end, concurrent features, audio-video communication, etc. In two out of three semesters, my supervised teams won the best project award in the whole class.</p>

<p><strong>Business QR:</strong> An app built to replace business cards, this project will help students organize and strengthen their networking efforts in order to build a better career for themselves. Instead of carrying around large amounts of business cards, recruiters/professionals can just carry around one QR code on either their phone or in physical form. When intending to hand out their business information, the recipient will just scan the code, and the information will be added to this app, which will serve as a business address book. Information given can with the code can include, name, company, position, contact information, and a photo, all optional. This can be especially useful at career fairs, where instead of jotting down notes on the back of a notecard and trying to remember vague details about the encounter, the app will allow you to insert your own notes for each contact.</p>

The program will also allow users to submit a list of recipes, which will then return a shopping list of ingredients (and how much of each) required to make those recipes. This will also work the other way around, give the program a list of ingredients you have around your home and it will return a list of possible recipes that can be made with those ingredients. Through the app users will be allowed to share, rate, and discuss recipes with others, like a social media platform for cooking.</p>

They can then create an offering. They do this by listing what they will offer (service/product/&hellip;), their contact information, and the price of their services, and a location marker of where they&rsquo;re located (for future expansion). Other users can then purchase these products/services. A user can also request a service.</p>
