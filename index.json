In data-driven software, the processes are organized in several stages such as data acquisition, data preprocessing, modeling, training, evaluation, prediction, and so on, where the data flow from one stage to another. The stages with different subtasks, their connections, and feedback loops, create a new kind of software architecture called Data Science Pipeline. In order to design and build software systems with data science stages effectively, we must understand the structure of the data science pipelines. We demonstrated the importance of standardization and analysis framework for data science pipelines. We took the first step to understand the architecture and patterns of data science pipelines from theory and practice. We conducted a three-pronged study to draw observations from pipelines in the literature and popular press, smaller data science tasks, and large projects. They investigated the representation of the pipeline structure, its organization, and characteristics. What are the typical stages of a data science pipeline? How are they connected? Do the pipelines differ in the theoretical representations and that in the practice? Today we do not fully understand these architectural characteristics. The study resulted in three representative pipeline structures. The work also informs the terminology and design criteria for pipelines. For example, a number of stages from theory are absent in the pipelines in small data science programs without a clear separation of stages. On the other hand, the pipelines in large data science projects develop complex pipelines with feedback loops and sub-pipelines. The stage boundaries are stricter in large projects, which is necessary for scalability, maintenance, and testing of pipelines. The results will facilitate pipeline architects, practitioners, and software engineering teams to compare with existing and representative pipelines. For instance, a data scientist can identify whether the pipeline is missing any important stage or feedback loops in an earlier stage of development lifecycle, which will save much time and effort.\nWe presented the results of the paper entitled \u0026ldquo;The Art and Practice of Data Science Pipelines: A Comprehensive Study of Data Science Pipelines In Theory, In-The-Small, and In-The-Large\u0026rdquo;, in the research technical track of the 44th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2022) held in Pittsburgh, PA, USA from May 21-29, 2022.\nThe project has been supported in part by the National Science Foundation TRIPODS institute at ISU called D4 (Dependable Data-Driven Discovery).

We have seen a number of those news in last few yers. The machine learning (ML) models used to make the predictions can exhibit bias for various reasons. In this project, we address the algorithmic fairness of the models, which is measured from the predictions of the model.\nReported fairness violations Many research looked at the problem and proposed different measures and mitigations to make the models fairer. However, the prior works consider the ML model wholistically as a black-box, and do not look at the fairness of components in the ML pipeline. ML pipeline can have several components and stages such as preprocessing, training, tuning, evaluation, etc. Each of them can affect the ultimate fairness of the model. Our goal is to investigate the fairness in the component-level and identify the modules that are causing the unfairness.\nReported fairness violations First, we do not consider the whole ML model as a single black box. Along with commenting on the fair of unfair behavior of the whole model, we look inside the black box and try to understand which components are responsible for the unfairness of the model. Our FSE'21 paper paper focused on identifying unfair preprocessing stages in ML pipeline.\nWhat is the fairness measure of a certain component/stage (e.g., imputation, scaling, etc.) in ML pipeline? Look at the following ML pipeline which is taken from the crime prediction analysis repository of Propublica. The pipeline operates on Compas dataset that contains records of about 7k defendants in Florida. This was used at US courts in at least 10 states including New York, Wisconsin, California, Florida, etc 1. The pipeline transforms data using six data transformers before applying the LogisticRegression model. For example, in line 2-5, custom data filtration was applied, and in line 12, an imputation method from the library was applied to replace the missing values for the feature is_recid. When we measure the fairness of this model using existing metrics such as statistical parity or equal opportunity, that does not say anything about the fairness of these data transformers.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 df = pd.read_csv(f_path) df = df[(df.days_b_screening_arrest \u0026lt;= 30) \u0026amp; (df.days_b_screening_arrest \u0026gt;= -30) \u0026amp; (df.is_recid != -1) \u0026amp; (df.c_charge_degree != \u0026#39;O\u0026#39;) \u0026amp; (df.score_text != \u0026#39;N/A\u0026#39;)] df = df.replace(\u0026#39;Medium\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Low\u0026#39;) labels = LabelEncoder().fit_transform(df.score_text) impute1_onehot = Pipeline([ (\u0026#39;imputer1\u0026#39;, SimpleImputer(strategy=\u0026#39;most_frequent\u0026#39;)), (\u0026#39;onehot\u0026#39;, OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown=\u0026#39;ignore\u0026#39;))]) impute2_bin = Pipeline([ (\u0026#39;imputer2\u0026#39;, SimpleImputer(strategy=\u0026#39;mean\u0026#39;)), (\u0026#39;discretizer\u0026#39;, KBinsDiscretizer(n_bins=4, encode=\u0026#39;ordinal\u0026#39;, strategy=\u0026#39;uniform\u0026#39;))]) featurizer = ColumnTransformer(transformers=[ (\u0026#39;impute1_onehot\u0026#39;, impute1_onehot, [\u0026#39;is_recid\u0026#39;]), (\u0026#39;impute2_bin\u0026#39;, impute2_bin, [\u0026#39;age\u0026#39;])]) pipeline = Pipeline([(\u0026#39;features\u0026#39;, featurizer), (\u0026#39;classifier\u0026#39;, LogisticRegression())]) We used causal reasoning in software to identify the fairness impact of those stages in the prediction.\nCausality in Software Identifying causal effects has been an integral part of scientific inquiry. It helped to answer a wide range of questions like - understanding behavior in online systems, or effect of social policies, or risk factors for diseases and so on.\nIn causal testing, given a failing test, causal experiments are conducted to find a set of test-passing inputs that are close to the failing input. In this project, we also used this casual modeling on the pipeline. We intervene on one variable of interest at a time and observe the change in the outcome.\nFor two random variables $X$ and $Y$, we say that $X$ causes $Y$ when there exist at least two different interventions on $X$ that result in two different probability distributions of $Y$. Causality in Fairness Causality in fairness has also been studied in the literature. “Other things being equal”, prediction would not have changed in the counterfactual world, where only the intervened variable would have changed.\nA predictor $\\hat{Y}$ is said to satisfy causal fairness if\n$$ P(\\hat{Y}(a, U) = y | X = x, A = a) = P(\\hat{Y}(a\u0026rsquo;, U) = y | X = x, A = a) $$\nWe create an alternative pipeline $\\mathcal{P}* $ from the given pipeline $\\mathcal{P} $ by removing the preprocessing stage in consideration. Then we look at the prediction disparity between $\\mathcal{P} $ and $\\mathcal{P}* $. The disparity can be fairness satisfying or not. To evaluate that, we used the existing fairness criteria from the literature.\nThus, we proposed four novel metrics to measure fairness of a stage in the ML pipeline. We observed a number of patterns of fairness of the the data transformers that are commonly used in pipelines.\nData filtering and missing value removal change the data distribution and hence introduce bias in ML pipeline.\nNew feature generation or feature transformation can have large impact on fairness.\nEncoding techniques should be chosen cautiosly based on the classifier.\nSimilar to the tradeoff between the accuracy and fairness for the classifier, the stages of the pipelines also exhibit the tradeoff. Often the accuracy-improve data transformer is unfair.\nAmong all the transformers, applying sampling technique exhibits most unfairness.\nSelecting a subset of features often increase unfairness.\nFeature standardization and non-linear transformers are fair transformers.\nFurthermore, another impact that our method could attain is that we can instrument the pipeline. A pipeline can have a unfair stage that favors the privileged. Similarly, there can be another stage that favors the unprivileged. Both stages can be used in a pipeline such that their unfairness is canceled.\nThe fairness composition can help to choose appropriate alternatives while development and improve the overall fairness. We noticed that the most popular fairness packages (e.g., AIF360) uses a default data preprocessing each time users import datasets from the packages. There is no option to control or measure the unfair stages in the pipeline. Our early results would provide guidance to analyze fairness at a component-level. Further research in the area is in progress to understand fairness composition and optimize the pipeline construction.\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":1622160000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1622160000,"objectID":"534bc5f72e3d9085729e1f3b1f923837","permalink":"https://sumonbis.github.io/project/modular-fairness/","publishdate":"2021-05-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/modular-fairness/","section":"project","summary":"We used causal reasoning to measure fairness of components and remove them from machine learning pipeline.","tags":["Fairness"],"title":"Causal Fairness in Machine Learning Pipeline","type":"project"},{"authors":["Sumon Biswas","Hridesh Rajan"],"categories":["conference"],"content":" ","date":1621563933,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621563933,"objectID":"75a3bd006e2342f9c8ff200f1fce4304","permalink":"https://sumonbis.github.io/publication/esec-fse21/","publishdate":"2021-06-05T21:25:33-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/esec-fse21/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduced the causal method of fairness to reason about the fairness impact of data preprocessing stages in ML pipeline.

With the availability of numerous data, AI systems are becoming more popular in various sectors. Many of these systems affect human lives directly in one way or another. Our research highlighted that many of such real-world machine learning (ML) models exhibit unfairness with respect to certain societal groups of race, sex or age. In the last few years, our software design lab employed significant effort to identify fairness in machine learning algorithms and mitigate that effectively. Recent result shows that several components in an ML pipeline are influencing the predictive result that is unfair to minority groups such as dark-skinned people or female.\nI and my advisor Hridesh Rajan are working in the D4 Institute at Iowa State which broadly focuses on increasing the dependability of AI-based systems.\nThe accuracy of a model is not always telling the whole story. How much bias the model propagates or how much we can trust the prediction is a big question.\nThese AI-based software are being used in hiring employees, approving loans, criminal sentencing, which should be more accountable and explainable. Analyzing the behavior of ML pipeline in component level would help towards that goal. Our paper proposing a novel method to identify unfairness of ML components has been recently accepted in ESEC/FSE 2021, which is one of top software engineering conference and internationally renowned forum for researchers, practitioners, and educators.\nIn the paper, we proposed a causal method to measure the fairness of different stages in ML pipeline.\nAlthough some recent work proposed metrics to quantify the bias in the predictions, ML software is complex having several stages. Our method could effectively identify the data transformers that caused unfairness in such software.\nWe strongly believe that the researchers and practitioners would be able to leverage our approach to avoid biased data preprocessing.

He also attended the Midwest Big Data Summer School where he learned cutting-edge research methods that further drew him into studying the data science life cycle.\nSpecifically, I looked deep into the data science pipeline, which is a ordered set of stages including data collection, exploratory analysis, data preprocessing, modeling, training, evaluation, and different properties of the pipeline.\n“It’s been incredible,” Biswas said. “I’ve learned novel research ideas from D4 researchers and practitioners who have introduced me to studying the data science pipeline and its properties.”\nI already published my research work on ensuring fairness of machine learning models. The work analyzes different fairness measures, mitigation techniques, and their impacts in real-world ML based software.\nBiswas is close to publishing his own research which he conducted at the D4 Institute. “It’s exciting to be involved in research that could improve software systems, which affect many people who are impacted by data-driven decisions,” he said.\nRajan and his team plan to hire additional undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs at the D4 Institute. More students, like Biswas, will benefit from the experience of conducting NSF-funded research and working with seasoned experts who collaborate on studies.\nWe have a full-grown team of collaborators now, undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, industry partners, and professors from different expertise. I have also mentored undergraduate students and collaborated with others, which was a great experience to gain further knowledge, and share thoughts and ideas.\n","date":1597449600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600387200,"objectID":"74442bf515b9a9a635ce128d77164161","permalink":"https://sumonbis.github.io/post/d4-institute/","publishdate":"2020-08-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/d4-institute/","section":"post","summary":"D4 Institute is an interdisciplinary data science hub at Iowa State university where professors, graduate students, REU students, and researchers from Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, Statistics collaborate to ensure the dependability of data science.","tags":["Data science","Machine learning","Interdisciplinary"],"title":"Being a Part of A Premier Data Science Research Hub","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Software engineering (SE) research has focused on identifying, localizing, and repairing defects in software systems. With the evolution of programming languages, coding practices and requirements, various kinds of bugs of software has drawn interest. Recent trend of machine learning techniques has raised the question of dependability of the predictive decisions. Fairness of the machine learning (ML) models has been an open issue for such software systems in last few years. In critical decision making such as loan approval, crime prediction, college admission or hiring employees, ML algorithms are being used. However, the problem of fairness has not been studied by the SE community as much as the ML community looked into it. We conducted an empirical study in our FSE'20 paper to investigate a number of SE concerns of measures, mitigation, and impact of unfairness in ML models.\nIt is important to ensure the fairness of the ML models so that no discrimination is made based on protected attribute (e.g., race, sex, age) while decision making.\nFirst, it is important to look at the real-world software systems to understand the state of unfairness. Most of the study experiment using default-set classifiers from libraries. Thus, often the real faults and concerns with fairness are missed. However, it might be difficult to find such open-source models in the wild. We found a good number of models from Kaggle that helped to point down fairness issues in the wild.\nFairness Measures The foremost big concern is that how do we know there is a fairness issue in my model. Well, it depends on the stakeholder and the context. The participants could ask for equal opportunity, while the owners focus on the disparate impact. A popular library for fairness, AIF360 has more than 70 metrics to measure fairness. Two most common used broad categories of fairness measures are:\nGroup fairness Individual fairness The impossibility theorem of fairness suggests that satisfying fairness with respect to all the definition can not be achievable, since one definition can contradict another. Furthermore, fairness in classification problem has been focused is most of the works, while fairness of regression or ranking problems is not yet well studied.\nChoosing appropriate fairness metrics and optimizing them simultaneously is an important requirement engineering problem to be solved. We found several interesting finding from our experiments:\nOnly one fairness metric would not show the whole picture. There is no metric that combines multiples metric too.\nFairness metrics have their assumptions as well. Most of the group fairness metrics require the dataset divided into privileged and non-privileged. So, it can not compute unfairness among multiple groups (e.g., Asian, American, African, etc.) at the same time. Furthermore, the metrics measure fairness with respect to one protected attribute (race or sex or age). A fair model with respect to sex could be biased with respect to age.\nDevelopers often tend to optimize the models for accuracy, which causes unfairness.\nThe library APIs such as classifiers from Scikit-Learn have several constructs that affect fairness. But those are not document and developers are aware of their fairness impacts.\nIt is often thought that if data is fair, the model would be so too. Although data has a great deal of impact of fairness of the decisions, a model could be fairer which used biased data. At the same time, a model could be biased which was trained on unbiased data. We found that some data preparation techniques, thus, can have both positive or negative impact on fairness. Specifically, the data standardization and feature engineering (removal or creation) techniques affect fairness almost always.\nBias Mitigation There are many bias mitigation techniques proposed in the literature, which are grouped into these categories:\nPreprocessing techniques: These techniques operate on the training data to make the resulting model fairer. In-processing techniques: These techniques alters the existing mode. Post-processing techniques: The predictions are changes with some constraints to make them fairer. Choosing a bias mitigation technique can be also confusing. Applying one mitigation technique can work for a particular metric and hamper accuracy as well as another fairness metric. In our paper, we reported several observations that help to choose a mitigation technique for the model.\nEffective preprocessing mitigation technique is preferable, since it does not ruin accuracy in most of the cases.\nIf the model exhibits a lot of bias, post-processing techniques are the most successful.\nOriginally fairer models are debiased effectively by preprocessing or in-processing techniques.\nImpacts Fairnes does not come free. In most of models, there is a accuracy loss when the mitigation technique are applied. Multi-objective optimization could be utilized to improve fairness and accuracy together.\nIn-processing mitigation algorithms show uncertain behavior in their performance.\nAlthough post-processing algorithms are the most dominating in debiasing, they are always diminishing the model accuracy and F1 score.\nTrade-off between performance and fairness exists.\nOverall, ensuring fairness require to address many dimensions of the problem at the same time. There is a wrong perception that only debiasing training data would suffice to make the model fair. The training is not always uniform and it does not learn from all the data instances equally. So, its needed to make the learning process better as well. Because of the tradeoff, multiple metrics, domain-specific issues, we need further testing and verification mechanisms as well. A few studies proposed fairness aware language constructs and test input generation techniques. However, we need further languages, tools, and methods to localize the fairness issue and repair them in real-world situations.\n","date":1589846400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589846400,"objectID":"4fe69a435339d8181a0f74598e2d38b6","permalink":"https://sumonbis.github.io/project/empirical-fairness/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/empirical-fairness/","section":"project","summary":"We have studied the software engineering concerns of fairness in real-world machine learning models.","tags":["Fairness"],"title":"Fairness Engineering in ML Models","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Data science (DS) is everywhere now.

Recently, random search based strategies have been proven efficient for optimizing hyperparameters. However, programmers can not overtly represent uncertainty of the chosen hyperparameter values and accuracy of the model while performing a random search. In this project, we utilize a first order type Uncertain\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; to approximate the distributions of the hyperparameters so that programmers can pick values with certain confidence. This type helps us to represent uncertainty of random hyperparameters and allows us to easily propagate this uncertainty through computations, perform statistical tests on distributions without resorting to complicated statistical concepts, and determine uncertain hyperparameter value in required significance level.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there has not been any attempt to introduce the probabilistic programming concept in DNN hyperparameter optimization. The contributions of this project are as follows. First, we have implemented the first order type Uncertain\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; to hold the distribution of loss values over the randomly chosen hyperparameters. The main goal is to help programmers overtly represent uncertainty in chosen hyperparameters and make conditional statements using that. By using this type, we define algebra over random variables so that the uncertainty of the hyperparameters can propagate through the calculations and provide convergence speed and increase in accuracy. Second, our method performs significantly better than the random search method which is used by most of the DNN libraries. Our result shows that while 62% of the random search trials fall below the accuracy threshold, only 23% time our method fall below the threshold.\nIn this project, our goal is to aid the deep learning programmers to quantify uncertainty in the model hyperparameters and make an informed decision while initializing hyperparameters. A problem with the random search is that it doesn’t take uncertainty of random hyperparameters into account while picking a best value which may adversely impact models when trained on the different distribution of the input domain. To that end, we have leveraged a first order type Uncertain to represent the uncertainty in the random hyperparameters and choose best value by performing statistical tests on the distribution.

With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms and availability of huge amount of data, there has been a rapid increase of using DS components in software. To enable further software engineering (SE) research of DS software in the wild, we built an infrastructure to mine and analyze DS software in large-scale. Our goal is to:\nLearn from the past and guide future development of DS software Improve software design and reuse Manage DS software better Automatic bug detection and repair Many more \u0026hellip; We think that software engineering research for DS systems is necessary. To that end, we leveraged the huge amount of code and metadata available in open-source GitHub repositories. We proposed a methodology of filtering high-quality DS repositories and then mined code of each revision and project metadata e.g., number of developers, commit logs, creation-date, etc.\nWe used the existing Boa framework to mine from GitHub. Python has been used as a de-facto of ML based software for a long time now. However, Boa could not parse and mine Python code. Therefore, I built the infrastructure to parse the Python code, transform that into AST, and store in Boa\u0026rsquo;s Protobuf format for storing. I used ANTLR grammar for Python 2 and Python 3 for parsing the source. Finally, the dataset is stored in the Hadoop cluster for further analysis. You can learn about how to use the Boa for mining new datasets from this tutorial. The first version of the dataset contained about 5 million Python files (including all revisions) from top rated 1558 DS repositories.\nThe first version of the mined dataset The rich amount of data facilitates analyzing several research questions:\nData science development practices: Due to the recent ‘boom’ in machine learning software development, a lot of questions regearing DS best practices can be asked:\nWhat are the most used data preprocessing library? Why data dimension bugs are more frequent in deep neural networks? What data visualization APIs are most used in last two years? Software change: Since the dataset contains all the snapshots of Python files, how developers change source can be studied.\nProgram analysis: The differences between traditional and DS software development can be studied. For example, do the code complexity or API usages follow similar pattern in DS software?\nSE practices: Several SE research can be conducted on the DS projects in the area of:\nDS bug detection and repair Code comprehension Testing DS modules Project metadata: The project metadata can be leveraged to answer questions such as, what are the coding style differences between projects developed by individuals and organizations, etc.\nFurther details about the dataset can be found here. The domain-specific Boa language helps to perform program analysis query the metadata easily and quickly. For example, the following code snippet quickly count the number of bug-fixing revisions for all the projects in the dataset.\n# Counting the number of bug-fixing revisons for all projects p: Project = input; counts: output sum[string] of int; visit(p, visitor { before n: Project -\u0026gt; ; before node: CodeRepository -\u0026gt; ; before node: Revision -\u0026gt; if (isfixingrevision(node.log)) counts[p.name] \u0026lt;\u0026lt; 1; }); If we want to go deeper and mine the all the method calls in the bug-fixing revisions, we can use the following Boa program.\nExample Boa program for mining method calls in the bug fixing commits. Note that the output contains 74.11 million results. We use commit logs to identify whether it\u0026rsquo;s a bug-fixing revision or not and then visit the expression to get the method calls. Boa uses automatic parallelization to run the query in Haddop cluster. Users do not need to worry about the storage and low-level details.\nAs of this writing, no open source dataset for studying Data Science software is available.

In this project, our goal is to study two unique language constructs of Python: compound comparison statement and generator. Compound comparison statement is similar to regular if statement but it contains chaining comparison as conditions. Chaining comparison (e.g., x \u0026lt; 10 \u0026lt; x*10 \u0026lt; 100) is a syntactic sugar which combines two comparison operations into one.

Now, we will move on to data generation steps. Boa Data Generation Steps Go to github.com and search the project for which you want to create the dataset. For example, if you want to create dataset for Apache Mavan project, go to https://github.com/apache/maven . Invoke a GitHub http-based RESTful API to get the metadata of the project by constructing a URL https://api.github.com/repos/repo_full_name, for example https://api.github.com/repos/apache/maven. Copy the whole JSON metadata, create a blank text file, type a pair of brackets ‘[]’, paste the metadata inside the brackets. Search for \u0026ldquo;languages_url\u0026rdquo; field in the JSON data, go to the URL, copy everything, create another field in the JSON file (\u0026ldquo;language_list\u0026rdquo;: ), paste copied text and save the file as filename.json (e.g., maven.json). The last few lines of the JSON file should look like: JSON file In this way, for each project, that will be included in the dataset, create a JSON file. So, if you want to create a dataset for 5 projects, you will create 5 separate JSON files. Save all the JSON files in a folder. Alternatively, you can create a single JSON file for all of the projects by separating them by comma in an array ‘[]’. The format looks like [{}, {}]. Each curly brace is for one project. In Eclipse, go to the project compiler \u0026gt; src/java \u0026gt; boa.datagen, right click on BoaGenerator.java \u0026gt; Run As \u0026gt; Run Configurations. Double click on Java Application to create a new configuration. Browse project and select compiler, Search Main Class and select boa.datagen.BoaGenerator.

I got the opportunity to be a judge of the competition and see the outstanding computational projects developed by bright youngsters!\nScience fair-like format where participants come prepared to present their projects to a panel of experts.\nComputational thinking is critical skill that is needed for the success in the 21st century. The exposure to problem solving skills at an early stage helps the students greatly in their future endeavor. Since Fall 2010, the ISU Computer Science Department has been making efforts in Iowa K-12 schools with a series of events and workshops designed to help K-12 educators, parents, and students learn about computational thinking.\nTrophies, Prizes, Awards of Excellence, and Certificates of Participation. Prizes included laptops, tablets and Raspberry PIs.\nThis particular event was last Saturday at Iowa State campus. The computer faculties who were involved in the outreach program are: Wallapak Tavanapong, Soma Chaudhuri, Yan-Bin Jia, Lu Ruan, Simanta Mitra, and Oliver Eulenstein.\nI joined the panel of judges along with other graduate students. I was really amazed to see how interesting and skillful projects were developed by the young students. The students competed in the following groups:\nK 3 K 4-6 K 7-9 K 10-12 Contestants could work in small groups of two or by themselves. The judgements were mainly based on the difficulty of the problem, cleverness of the solution, and ability of the students to explain.\nMost of the younger students were using the Scratch platform developed in MIT, to learn and build interesting games. Scratch is designed and maintained by the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab. Here is an example project Speech Helper 2.0 built by Carson and McClain Crigger, both sixth graders at South Middle School in Waukee, IA. The program is designed to help their younger brother practice letter sounds.\nScratch is a programming language and an online community where children can program and share interactive media such as stories, games, and animation with people from all over the world.\nIt was fascinating to see the coding skill of the kids and how they are engaged in the activity. There were three projects in the K 10-12 group which were solving complex problem with exciting ideas:\nProject Mardiop by Adam Project Electric Field Simulation by Brandt Project Fast Intersection by Prithvi Those projects were rich in formulating the problem, organizing and analyzing data, and testing and managing their code.

I have built the Naive Bayes classifier from the training data (train label.csv, train data.csv), then evaluated its performance on the testing data (test label.csv, test data.csv).\nDataset The 20 Newsgroups dataset is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. It was originally collected by Ken Lang, probably for his Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews[1] paper.The 20 newsgroups collection has become a popular data set for experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as text classification and text clustering. The data is organized into 20 different newsgroups, each corresponding to a different topic.\nThe original data set is available at http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/. It includes 18824 documents which have been divided to two subsets: training (11269 documents) and testing (7505 documents). The vocabulary.txt contains all distinct words and other tokens in the 18824 documents. train data.csv and test data.csv are formatted \u0026ldquo;docIdx, wordIdx, count\u0026rdquo;, where docIdx is the document id, wordIdx represents the word id (in correspondence to vocabulary.txt) and count is the frequency of the word in the document. train label.csv and test label.csv are simply a list of label id’s indicating which newsgroup each document belongs to. The map.csv maps from label id’s to label names.\nInstructions to run the program:\nCopy all *.java files to one directory.

Many Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) algorithms have been recently developed to solve this problem. Among them simhash is a very efficient LSH algorithm that uses probabilistic method to generate similar fingerprints for similar objects. In this project, we have implemented simhash algorithm to evaluate approximate cosine similarity between two documents from a large collection of files. We have preprocessed the documents, created word vectors with weight and then implemented simhash algorithm to generate 64-bit fingerprint of each document. Then we have implemented block permuted hamming search in our fingerprint space. Block permuted Hamming search helps us to reduce the time to find similar pairs significantly. However, we have to consider a few false negatives in this result. By designing the block permutation in a better way, we can reduce the false negative rate.\nDetail project report: https://github.com/sumonbis/NearDuplicateDetection/blob/master/Report.pdf\nProblem Definition Suppose, we have millions of documents and given a new document we have to find all the near duplicates (e.g., 95% or more similar) from the collection in a reasonable amount of time. We can divide the problem into two parts: how to measure similarity between two documents and how to find the similar documents form a large collection efficiently? Therefore, our goal is to solve the following problems:\nGiven two documents D_a and D_b, what is the similarity measure between them? Given a document D_a, find all the documents that are similar to D_a. Identify all the pairs in the collection that are near duplicate of each other. There are a few challenges related to the above problems. First, our algorithm should be designed for millions of documents. Second, the files should be compressed enough to fit in memory. Finally, the algorithm must be efficient to find near duplicate in small amount of time.\nSimhash Charikar’s simhash [1] is a dimensionality reduction technique which maps high dimensional documents to very small sized fingerprints. We can compute the Hamming distance of two finger- prints to measure the cosine similarity.\nAlgorithm The basic sketch of using simhash algorithm to measure similarity is:\nStep 1: Convert the document into set of features associated with weights. Step 2: Create f-bit fingerprint for each document. Step 3: Calculate Hamming distance between two fingerprints to measure similarity between corresponding documents. First, we have to choose features for each document. Feature selection also depends on the application. Word is a very obvious choice as features. We can also choose shingle as feature. A k-shingle is every k-length adjacent set of characters. Consider the sentence - “The earth is moving.” The set of k-shingles for k = 5: {The_e, he_ea, e_ear, _eart, . . .}. If the application requires such similarity measure that demands the order of appearance then shingle can be a good choice as feature. In this project, we used word as our feature. There are some preprocessing before converting them as set of features. We converted the whole document to lowercase as case sensitivity does not contribute to similarity score. Then we have removed the stop words (e.g., a, an, the etc.) and punctuation symbols which are common in every document. Next, the weight of each word is calculated. There are several ways to calculate the weight of each feature. The feature with more weight will contribute more to the similarity score. A very intuitive weight measure is the frequency of each term. The term which appears more in a document carries more weight. We can also use TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) as weight. After the preprocessing is done, we create f-bit binary fingerprint of each document using simhash algorithm. The value of f is 32 or 64 in practice. First, each feature is converted to a f-bit binary hash value using a uniformly distributed hash function (e.g., MD5, FNV, Murmur). Then we define a vector of length f, initially with all zero values. Now, we iterate through each bit position (1 to f). If the bit position is 1 then we add the weight and if the bit position is 0 then we subtract the weight. After all the iterations, we get a vector of real values of length f. Finally, if the ith value is negative we convert it to 0, otherwise we convert it to 1. Thus, we get f-bit fingerprint of a document.\nReferences Moses S Charikar.

While using cloud platform or any other insecure memory, attack can be made using the access pattern. Oblivious RAM is the way to hide the memory access pattern with some extra bandwidth and memory overhead.\nPath Oram Implementation Path ORAM uses a binary tree to store all memory blocks. Each node of the tree is a bucket which can contain a fixed number of block. First, we define all necessary data structure. The depth of the tree is ceiling(log N). The empty blocks are filled with dummy data. Each leaf node is a distinct branch and each block is mapped to a random branch. For each operation, we perform read and write through the branch. Since, the blocks are positioned to different branches, repeated operations do not disclose any information. A local memory is used to read and re-write the data. Path ORAM uses limited amount of memory and bandwidth with respect to other oblivious algorithms. This is an implementation described in the following paper: https://people.csail.mit.edu/devadas/pubs/PathORam.pdf\nSecurity Path ORAM changes the location of block repeatedly and accesses the whole branch for a single block. Therefore, the pattern of access is always random. However, the security is dependent mostly on the random branch selection of the blocks. We used python package numpy to obtain uniformly distributed random integer.\nPerformance For each access, we go through the whole path twice, once for reading and again for writing. So, we need to access twice the depth of the tree. Since, depth is ceiling(log N), the performance also sticks to that.\nUnit Test The correctness holds because the path we access includes the intended block. And after each access the block is remapped to another branch so that access to same block does not repeat the same set of blocks.\n","date":1484265600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1484265600,"objectID":"a4a47b58fdc6f8bd6b90f318f7662759","permalink":"https://sumonbis.github.io/academic-project/path-oram/","publishdate":"2017-01-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/academic-project/path-oram/","section":"academic-project","summary":"While using cloud platform or any other insecure memory, attack can be made using the access pattern.

We take two datasets (Facebook dataset from Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection and bibliography dataset from DBLP) and import that into MySQL, and Neo4J (Graph based DB) to evaluate the metrics for different network topology.\nAbstract For the past one decade, social network has gained a lot of popularity and more users are making their online presence to connect. Hence, it brings up new challenges for analyzing data generated from these users. One such analysis is the social connection between two users. A lot of work has been done in the past with regard to link analysis. From a given snapshot of a social network database, we can predict for a given person (or the entire network), the people who she can be potentially connected to, by analyzing her existing links. Although there are is a lot of effort put into developing new prediction techniques, there is no solid function for analyzing which database is suited for a particular link analysis method. Link prediction can be done either for the entire network, or for a small subset of the network graph centered on a particular user. We consider the latter in this project.\nWe take open datasets and import it into MySQL (for relational), and Neo4J (for Graph based) and evaluate several link metrics. Experimentally, we plan on classifying how performance varies with respect to metrics for different databases. We also plan to analyze on how link metrics vary according to the network topology/parameters. We try to improve the performance of the queries implemented in the referenced paper : “Implementing link-prediction for social networks in a database system” by Sarah Cohen et al. Our experiment is performed on eight different real social network datasets taken from SNAP and DBLP databases. Finally, the results verify that the changes brought about in the neo4J schema and query structure improve the performance.\n","date":1471219200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1471219200,"objectID":"c6977b6157935b9d513d8d276ad4561a","permalink":"https://sumonbis.github.io/academic-project/social-network/","publishdate":"2016-08-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/academic-project/social-network/","section":"academic-project","summary":"From a given snapshot of a social network database, we can predict whether a person can be potentially connected to another person, by analyzing existing links.
