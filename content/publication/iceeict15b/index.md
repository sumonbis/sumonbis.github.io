abstract: "Cloud computing encompasses a set of IT based Services, delivered by a third party provider who owns the infrastructure and provided to customers over a network. It is now one of the fastest growing technologies of the IT trade for business. Thus the high flexibility and portability of cloud have raised numerous security concerns. Security issue in cloud computing has become the vital reason of impeding its development. This paper shows a concern on the security element in cloud environment for small business addressing their shortcomings and finding solutions for it. Measured security features have been implemented by developing a secured data encryption, exchange and decryption infrastructure resulting in a data security model."
