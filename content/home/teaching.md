### [COMS 309 - Software Development Practices](/courses/software-development)
This is one of the largest computer science classes taught at Iowa State (~250 class size). I taught it for three semesters. One of the great experience in the course is to supervise many software project teams.

* **Topics:** Develop complex software in a team: from idea to release 
:radio_button: Software development criteria: client-server architecture, relational database, multi-user setting, concurrent features, e.g., online chat
:radio_button: Utilizing SE tools e.g., IDE, source-control, Git. 
  
### [COMS 327: Advanced Programming Techniques](/courses/advanced-programming)

This is also a very large class which I TA'ed for three semesters. Being heavy on the programming practices, I taught problem-solving, live coding, debugging, and testing.

* **Topics:** Differences between managed (Java) and unmanaged languages (C/C++) 
:radio_button: Design and build large programs from specification
:radio_button: Memory management in C and C++
:radio_button: Templates and standard library
:radio_button: Concurrent and network programming.
