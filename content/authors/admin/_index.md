I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at School of Computer Science, [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/), where I work in the Institute for Software Research ([ISR](https://s3d.cmu.edu/)). I'm working with [Dr. Eunsuk Kang](https://eskang.github.io/) on ensuring fairness and safety of high-assurance AI based software systems. I received Ph.D. in Computer Science from Iowa State University (ISU) under the supervision of [Dr. Hridesh Rajan](http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~hridesh/). For my dissertation, I worked on verifying and reasoning algorithmic fairness in ML pipeline.

My research at the intersection of **SE and AI** focuses on *identification, design, and verification* of fairness and safety properties.
At CMU, I'm working on the DARPA project *Verified Security \& Performance Enhancement of Large Legacy Software ([V-SPELLS](https://www.darpa.mil/program/verified-security-and-performance-enhancement-of-large-legacy-software))*, to model and verify safety of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV).
Prior to joining CMU, I worked in the NSF TRIPODS Institute [D4](https://tads.research.iastate.edu/) (Dependable Data-Driven Discovery), where I led the research on fairness engineering.
I also worked on the [Boa](http://boa.cs.iastate.edu/) compiler to enable large-scale static analysis and mining of ML software.
<!-- Especially, I built [Python language support](uploads/boa-python-MSR19.pdf) for Boa to analyze ML programs and Jupyter Notebooks.  -->
<!-- This I'malso interested in SE research using rich source of code and metadata available in GitHub, StackOverflow, Kaggle, and solve SE problems in the area of design, architecture, technical debt, defects, modularity, and evolution. -->
