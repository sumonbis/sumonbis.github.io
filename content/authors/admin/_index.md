I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Institute for Software Research (ISR), [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/). I am working with [Dr. Eunsuk Kang](https://eskang.github.io/) on the safety and fairness of high-assurance AI based software systems.
I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Iowa State University (ISU) under the supervision of [Dr. Hridesh Rajan](http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~hridesh/). For my dissertation, I worked on verifying and reasoning algorithmic fairness in machine learning pipeline.

### Research

My research interests are in the intersection of Software Engineering (SE), Programming Languages (PL), and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Especially, my research focuses on the design and formal modeling in the *SE for AI* area.
Previously, I worked in the [D4](https://tads.research.iastate.edu/) (Dependable Data-Driven Discovery) Institute at ISU and focused on the dependability of data-driven software. Especially, my research unraveled several SE aspects, compositional reasoning, and verification of fairness property in real-world ML pipelines.

My research combines the formalization and its application in real-world software. I worked on mining open source repositories and conducted large-scale program analysis using the Boa domain-specific language. I built Python language support for the [Boa](http://boa.cs.iastate.edu/) compiler and analyzed machine learning (ML) programs and Jupyter Notebooks. I am also interested in SE research using rich source of code and metadata available in GitHub, StackOverflow, Kaggle, and solve SE problems in the area of design, architecture, technical debt, defects, modularity, and evolution.
